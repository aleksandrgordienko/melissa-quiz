    "greetings": "Hi! This is a quiz-bot.\nAfter adding to group chat, you could play a quiz by sending command /play ({min_members} min users in group). You'll have {max_time} seconds for each question. If nobody sent correct answer, the game stops accepting answers.\n\nAppropriate commands:\n/play - play game\n/ask - ask question again\n/hint - free hint (1 time in {hint_pause} sec.)\n/next - go to the next question\n/score - your result\n/top10 - top 10 player\n\nWanna run bot like this?
